# SunSpot Activity Analysis Using Genetic Algorithm and Time Series.

This report uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) with three different crossovers to investigate Solar Activity using Time Series Analysis. 
The report highlights GAâ€™s specification search in parameter tuning of ARIMA may not be suitable for small datasets. 
The findings of the report require further experiments with different fitness functions & datasets to investigate 
the results of GA tuned parameters for ARIMA model.
